# Drag and Drop

This project is to practice using the React DnD(Drag 'n Drop) library in a NextJS application. This purpose of this project is to allow the user to drag options into containers and save the selections. The possible selections a user can pick from are rendered in a column on the left side of the Drag Container. There are multiple boxes for the user to choose from where they can drag and drop selections. For the purposes of this project, saving the selections will just be console logged because there is no backend db to handle users, authentication and save selection state.
